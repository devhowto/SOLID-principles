# Liskov Substitution Principle

Named after Barbara Liskov.

**RULE**: Objects should be replaceable with their sub-types without affecting the correctness of the program.

The ‚ÄúIs-A‚Äù way of thinking does not work well for every possible situation.

## Birds, Ducks and Ostriches

A rubber duck is a duck, but it doesn‚Äôt fly. An ostrich is a bird, but it doesn‚Äôt fly either. If a class `Bird` has a `fly` method, and `RubberDuck` and `Ostrich` classes inherit from (extends) `Bird`, what to do about the `fly` method in these two subclasses?

We cannot use a `RubberDuck` or an `Ostrich` in all the places we would use a ‚Äúbird‚Äù because the `fly` method would have to NOT fly.

The Liskov Substitution Principle requires a test that is more strict than an *Is-A* test. We have to move away from the ‚ÄúIs-A‚Äù way of thinking.

> If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, but it needs batteries, you probably have the wrong abstraction. üòÖ



```java
public class Bird {
  public void fly() {
    System.out.println("I'm flying!");
  }
}

public class RubberDuck extends Bird {
  @Override
  public void fly() {
    throw new RuntimeException("fly() method not implemented.");
  }
}
```

The `fly()` method in `RubberDuck` changes the behavior of the program.



## Cars

A racing car is a car, but it has a cockpit, while normal cars have cabins. You would have a `getCabinWidth()` for normal cars, but it would be wrong for racing cars, which should have a `getCockpitWidth()` instead.

A `Racecar` would have to override `getCabinWidth()` to do nothing, or throw a ‚Äúnot implemented‚Äù exception. It also would change the behavior of the program, and we would need conditionals in the client code to call the correct method depending on the type of the car.
